# Namste React

# Babel = babel is compiler which convertes jsx into normal html in browser.

# functional Component = A function which is returning some piece of JSX is called fun Com.

# component composition = composing two components into one another is called Component Composition.

# React.fragment (<> </>) behaves like an empty tag.

# props are just an argument in the functional Component.

# config driven UI = when the UI is changed based on the data coming from backend (for paticulare locations and country) this process is called config driven UI.

# l = 4 time 1.48 mint (erase all resobj.data)

# whenever use map() method give 'key' property to this because it will not re-render all the existing element again it will just add another element with unique id.

# don't use index as a key in react its recommended

# 2 type of export 1= default export 2= named export (use named export if you have to export multiple things)

# WHY react is fast = it can do faster dom manipulation,

# Hooks = its a normal js utilities function it has some super powers

there is 2 hooks

- useState() - Superpowerful react variables
  whenever a state variable updates react rerenders the comoponent.

-useEffect( () => {}, [])- useeffect callback function is called after body is rendered

# fetch() method = it fetch data from api

react uses Reaconciliation Algorithm
react fiber architechture ?

why react fast = beacuse it has virtual dom it can do efficient dom manipulation

# virtual DOM

virtual dom is a representation of actual dom

# monolith architechture

very big project earlier use this method

# how application fetch data from backend

1= load > API call > Render
2= load > Render > API > Rerender( mostly used better approach )

# shimmer UI

it is used to show the dummy content before loading the actual data.

# conditional rendering

rendering on the basis of condition ex- showing shimmer ui before get the resulta from API results.
